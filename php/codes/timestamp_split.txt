$timestamp = "2012-10-19 18:19:56";
$splitTimeStamp = explode(" ",$timestamp);
$date = $splitTimeStamp[0];
$time = $splitTimeStamp[1];

Another way of doing this would be this would be to use strtotime() combined with date()-

$date = date('Y-m-d',strtotime($timestamp));
$time = date('H:i:s',strtotime($timestamp));
